      "nameSanskrit": "Adho Mukha Svanasana",
      "nameEnglish": "Downward Facing Dog",
      "description": "Downward Facing Dog is perhaps the most recognized posture in Yoga, and one of my personal favorites. The pose is a forward bend named after the resemblance to a dog stretching out with its hind legs extending upward and both head and forelegs facing downward.",
      "instructions": "1) Come to your hands and knees with your wrists underneath the shoulders and your knees underneath the hips. 2) Curl your toes under and push back through your hands to lift your hips and straighten your legs. 3) Spread your fingers and ground down from the forearms into the fingertips. 4) Outwardly rotate your upper arms to broaden the collarbones. 5) Let your head hang and move your shoulder blades away from your ears towards your hips. 6) Engage your quadriceps strongly to take the burden of your body's weight off your arms. This action goes a long way toward making this a resting pose. 7) Rotate your thighs inward, keep your tail high, and sink your heels towards the floor. 8) Check that the distance between your hands and feet is correct by coming forward to a plank position. The distance between the hands and feet should be the same in these two poses. Do not step the feet toward the hands in Down Dog in order the get the heels to the floor. 9) Exhale and bend your knees to release and come back to your hands and knees",
      "benefits": "Stretches the hamstrings and calves, and it strengthens the arms and legs. The pose also helps increase the strength of the external oblique abdominal muscles. As a mild inversion, Downward Dog acts in reverse of the usual forces on your spine and brings more blood flow to your brain. When incorporated into a weekly yoga practice, it may even help relieve chronic back pain.",
